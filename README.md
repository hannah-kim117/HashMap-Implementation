# HashMap-Implementation

Completed a HashMap Implementation in two forms- using Separate Chaining, and again via Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing through the use of a dynamic array and singly linked list.
These methods must be implemented for Separate Chaining AND for Open Addressing:

put()

empty_buckets() 

table_load() 

clear() 

resize_table() 

get() 

contains_key() 

remove() 

get_keys_and_values() 

This method is implemented for Separate Chaining ONLY:

find_mode() 

These methods are implemented for Open Addressing ONLY:

__iter__(), __next__() [iterator implementation]
